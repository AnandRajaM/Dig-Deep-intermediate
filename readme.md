# Vulnerabilities and Bugs in the Repository

This repository contains a web application with several vulnerabilities and bugs identified in different files.

## How to Get Your TOKEN

To obtain the token, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Bugs/Vulnerabilities**: All bugs/vulnerabilities are found in single lines of code throughout the repository. None of them span multiple lines.

2. **Identify the Line Numbers**: As you find each bug, take note of the corresponding line number.

3. **Calculate the Token**: Once you have identified all the line numbers where bugs are located, add them together. 

4. **Submit the Token**: The sum of the line numbers will be your TOKEN. Submit this TOKEN to receive your reward!

### EXAMPLE

If you find bugs on lines 5 (from userModel.js), 12(from connect.js), and 20 (from authUtils.js), you would calculate the TOKEN as follows:  
5 + 12 + 20 = **37**  
Your TOKEN would be **37**.
